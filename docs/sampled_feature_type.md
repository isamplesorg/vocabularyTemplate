# **Concept scheme:** Sampled Feature Type vocabulary

Vocabulary last modified:  2022-12-09

subtitle: 
  Categories to specify the broad context that a sample is intended to represent.

Namespace: 
[`https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/sampledfeature/1.0/sampledfeaturevocabulary`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/sampledfeature/1.0/sampledfeaturevocabulary)

**History**

* 2021-12-10 SMR add missing skos:inScheme statements
* 2022-01-07 SMR change to https://w3id.org/isample/ uri base, make the ConceptScheme an ontology as well. For uploading to ESIP COR and w3id resolution redirect set up. Add some mappings to other ontologies using seeAlso, closeMatch, narrowMatch.
* 2022-03-11 SMR change definitions from rdfs:comment to skos:definition. Minor fixes in definitions. Add skos matches to URIs from other vocabularies. Fix typo in glacierenvrionment URI (changed the URI to glacierenvironment)
* 2022-09-07 SMR update some of the skos mappings to other vocabularies; remove references to other vocabularies as NamedIndividual. Remove rocksample class, it was not linked in hierarchy and inconsistent with design.
* 2022-09-30 add biological entity as sampled feature, per issue https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata/issues/107. This update was lost at some point and added back in 2022-12-09.
* 2023-11-05 SMR update version to 1.0, prep for release
* Remove Marine biome, Subaerial terrestrial environment, Subaqueous terrestrial environment per github issue https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata/issues/41. Make Experiment setting and Laboratory or curatorial environemtn  subclasses of Active human occupation site.

vocabulary.
